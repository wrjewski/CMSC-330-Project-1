# CMSC-330-Project-1

# Approach
When I first started working on this project, my initial step was to look over all the files and familiarize myself with the project files. After setting everything up, I ran the program to see the errors and make sure I could take the next steps needed without inducing more issues, I am a step by step person and donâ€™t like to work to ahead of myself.
Once I had a general understanding of what needed to get done to get the project to work, I focused on creating the missing files. After that I started with Main.java, since it contained the entry point of the program, and then moved to Parser.java and Lexer.java, where the parsing functionality was implemented. I spent a lot of time understanding how the lexer was breaking down the input from the scene file and how the parser was using those tokens to create graphical objects. This process helped me recognize the importance of structured input and how it translated into visual elements.
To further my understanding, I used debugging tools from VScode and print statements to track how data was being processed. A major challenge I faced was ensuring that all graphical elements, such as different shapes and text, were properly rendered based on the input file. Out of all the shapes Parrelegram gave me the most struggles.
Throughout the project, I followed a structured approach by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps. I left comments to track my work, which helped me stay organized.
# Lessons Learned and Areas for Improvement
This project provided me with valuable experience in working with parsers, lexical analysis, and graphical rendering in Java. One of the biggest takeaways was understanding how structured input is broken down and processed using a lexer and parser. Before working on this project, I had little to none understanding of how lexers and parsers functioned, after using the class materials and taking my learning from my time spent in Codecademy and YouTube University I am starting to feel more comfortable.
# Potential Improvements
Right now, the program relies on a scene file for input. It would be a great enhancement to add a GUI where users can manually create and modify scenes in real time.
